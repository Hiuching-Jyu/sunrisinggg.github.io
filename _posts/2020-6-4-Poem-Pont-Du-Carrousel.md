PONT DU CARROUSEL

<font size="3" face="Comic Sans MS"><center>Upon the bridge the blind man stands alone,

 Gray like a mist veiled monument he towers 

 As though of nameless realms the boundary stone 

 About which circle distant starry hours. 


 He seems the center around which stars glow 

 While all earth's ostentations surge below. 


 Immovably and silently he stands 

 Placed where the confused current ebbs and flows 

 Past fathomless dark depths that he commands 

 A shallow generation drifting goes . . . </center></font>
