# About Sunrise

## Poem (Foreword)
<font color=#FF7F50 size=3> Greeting The Sunrise </font>
<br>Greeting the sunrise,
<br>it is not only a kind of sensual joviality,
<br>but a kind of spiritual experience;
<br>it is not only a human's reading of nature,
<br>but the nature with its magical effect on life in the round of the impact.

<br>Greeting the saintlike sunrise,
<br>let's do it on time.
<br>Well,
<br>this is a sign of a healthy and enthusiastic disposition in life,
<br>it is the sign of bright spirit.

<br>Greeting the orangered sunrise,
<br>I grasp a graceful silhouette:
<br>a human is holding a sun-rising ceremony for his own life.

```
It is a  poem adapted by SRCharlotte from Kailing Wang's prose "精神明亮的人".
```
