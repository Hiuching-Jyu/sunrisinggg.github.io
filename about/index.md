# About Sunrise


## 1. Poem (Foreword)

<center>Greeting The <b>Sunrise</b> </center>
Greeting the sunrise,
<br>it is not only a kind of sensual joviality,
<br>but a kind of spiritual experience;
<br>it is not only a human's reading of nature,
<br>but the nature with its magical effect on life in the round of the impact.

<br>Greeting the saintlike sunrise,
<br>let's do it on time.
<br>Well,
<br>this is a sign of a healthy and enthusiastic disposition in life,
<br>it is the sign of bright spirit.

<br>Greeting the orangered sunrise,
<br>I grasp a graceful silhouette:
<br>a human is holding a sun-rising ceremony for his own life.

```
It is a poem adapted by me from Kailing Wang's prose "精神明亮的人".
```

## 2. How does the blog work?
There are four modules --- **"Somniloquys"** , **"Reading notes"** , **"Robotics"** , **"AI or others"** now. 

 **"Somniloquys"** is for some daily thoughts （I am not sure whether they will be accepted, so I would like to say them in the form of somnlioquy )and the latter one is for study notes.

 **"Reading notes"** is used to excerpt sentences from some of the reading(or read) books.

 **"Robotics"** includes some information about robotics and current study information.

 **"AI or others"** contains something like Deep Learning and Gaming.

## 3. What new function will be added?
I dont' know Hahaha.

It would be great if you could tell me that!
