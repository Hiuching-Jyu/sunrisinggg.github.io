# About Sunrise

## Poem (Foreword)
#### <font color=#FF7F50> Greeting The Sunrise</font>
Greeting the sunrise,
it is not only a kind of sensual joviality,
but a kind of spiritual experience;
it is not only a human's reading of nature,
but the nature with its magical effect on life in the round of the impact.

Greeting the saintlike sunrise,
let's do it on time.
Well,
this is a sign of a healthy and enthusiastic disposition in life,
it is the sign of bright spirit.

Greeting the orangered sunrise,
I grasp a graceful silhouette:
a human is holding a sun-rising ceremony for his own life.

  
   It is a  poem adapted by SRCharlotte from Kailing Wang's prose "精神明亮的人".
